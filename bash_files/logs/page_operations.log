Frequently Asked Questions
&nbsp;
Can you guarantee overnight delivery?
Guaranteed overnight delivery is available for our customers&nbsp;throughout the country.
See disclaimer below.
Disclaimer: Orders must be placed by 1pm EST cutoff time to guarantee next day&nbsp;delivery. &nbsp;Any orders placed on Friday after the 1pm EST cutoff time, Saturday or&nbsp;Sunday will not be processed until the following Monday. &nbsp;We advise&nbsp;shipping directly to the funeral home as residential delivery could delay&nbsp;transit time. &nbsp;Please do not hesitate to contact us if you need further&nbsp;assistance.
Why are your caskets priced so much lower than the funeral home?
We get our inventory from an independent manufacturer. &nbsp;We also do not&nbsp;have the high overhead of a funeral home, therefore we are able to offer&nbsp;supreme discounts on our products.
Can you guarantee the quality of the casket?
Yes, we at Overnight Caskets go through an extensive quality control process at the factory to&nbsp;ensure our caskets are of the highest quality. We offer a return or&nbsp;exchange policy if you are not satisfied with the casket. Please refer to our&nbsp;return policy.
How come the funeral home does not recommend buying a casket online?
Quite frankly, the funeral homes do not want you to purchase anything&nbsp;related to a funeral online because it takes directly business away from&nbsp;them. &nbsp;However, with the growing number of customers exploring the option&nbsp;of online casket purchasing, the &ldquo;steering&rdquo; of a customer to funeral home&nbsp;provided funeral necessities has reduced over the past couple years.
What if the funeral home will not accept the casket?
According to Federal Trade Commission&rsquo;s Funeral Rule&nbsp;(https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0300-ftc-funeral-rule)&nbsp;, to encourage&nbsp;fair trade and protection for the consumers, the funeral homes have no&nbsp;choice but to accept any caskets you chose whether from a third party&nbsp;vendor or not.&nbsp;Moreover, they cannot institute any extra fees or costs to&nbsp;accept caskets from a third party vendor.
If I purchase a casket from an outside source, is it necessary to inform the&nbsp;funeral home?
Under the guidelines of the FTC Funeral Rule mentioned above, it is not&nbsp;necessary to mention your intent to search elsewhere for funeral necessities.&nbsp;By law they have to show you a GPL (General Price List) of the products and&nbsp;services they offer and the prices of each. &nbsp;Once you see what they have to&nbsp;offer, then you may choose to inform them of your intent. While not&nbsp;required, it would be common courtesy to inform them of your decision.
Can I buy the casket for later use?
Yes, you may buy a casket for later use. However, we do not recommend it. We understand there are exceptions based on an individual's circumstances. We offer a 6 months storage and free delivery to your destination within the state of California.
Do you sell caskets for cremation?
Yes, we offer caskets for cremation. Scroll over &ldquo;Fine Wood Caskets&rdquo; in the top categories and click on &ldquo;Cremation Caskets&rdquo; in the drop down menu.
What does the &ldquo;gauge&rdquo; number refer to?
It refers to the thickness of the steel. &nbsp;The lower the gauge, the thicker the&nbsp;steel is. 18 gauge metal is thicker&nbsp;than 20 gauge metal, hence the&nbsp;occasional price increase.
What is a sealer or gasket casket?
It is a rubber seal on the gasket to keep water and air out. It&nbsp;has not been proven that a gasket sealer can slow the decomposition of a&nbsp;body. However, a gasket sealer may be required if transporting the deceased&nbsp;across state line or transporting by air, sea, or train.&nbsp;All of our metal caskets come with the rubber gasket sealer at no additional charge.
What kind of packaging do you use?
Our caskets are packaged in a Styrofoam contoured cardboard box, which is&nbsp;then put in a plywood box. This packaging is made specifically to prevent any type of damage when loading and unloading the casket.&nbsp;Please note, very few funeral homes require the customer or transportation company to&nbsp;dispose the packaging of the delivered casket. If the funeral home has such a requirement, please do not be worried.
Customers have 2 choices:
1. Do it yourself - At the time of delivery, take away packaging and dispose&nbsp;it yourself. The packaging is a cardboard box (can be folded up) and&nbsp;styrofoam (can be easily cut or broken into pieces). The packaging can then&nbsp;be taken away and desposed of.
2. The delivery company can take packaging away for a $35 fee. Please let us&nbsp;know at the time of purchase if you require the packaging disposal service&nbsp;(This service may not be available for some areas. Customer will not be&nbsp;charged for this service until we have confirmed the packaging has been&nbsp;disposed by the delivery company.)
Please note: If Overnight Caskets has not been informed prior to the purchsae about&nbsp;the disposal requirement, we cannot instruct the driver to take away&nbsp;packaging.
Is ordering a casket online a complex process?
Our online ordering process is quite simple. &nbsp;Simply browse our catalog of&nbsp;caskets for whatever suits your choice. &nbsp;Should you have any questions,&nbsp;our toll free Customer Service Center is open 24/7 to provide assistance with&nbsp;any inquiries you may have. &nbsp;We accept all major credit cards, PayPal, and&nbsp;also offer interest-free financing for 6 months. &nbsp;Please do not hesitate to ask&nbsp;about our special financing program. &nbsp;Our Customer Service Center will&nbsp;contact you immediately after you place your order to confirm all the&nbsp;necessary details. &nbsp;We will then contact the funeral home you designate to&nbsp;coordinate timely delivery.

        Content: FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS
Dealing with the passing of a loved one can create quite a number of unforeseen challenges. Not only is there massive emotional pain and grief to deal with, but planning a funeral also necessitates a significant outlay of time, energy &amp; money. Wrestling with these emotions while also needing to make sound, coherent choices for the family can often lead to frustration and dissent.&nbsp; Managing funeral costs can become quite the arduous task if not properly prepared.&nbsp; The average cost of a standard funeral ranges anywhere between $5500 and $7500.&nbsp; You should ask yourself if all these costs are indeed warranted.&nbsp; Oftentimes, due to the mental wear and tear from the overwhelming grief, as well as the need you feel to properly remember your deceased loved one, it is quite difficult to constrain your funeral expenses.&nbsp; Standard shopping tactics such as price negotiation and price comparison can be overlooked in such chaotic times.&nbsp; This leads to the majority of people paying much more than they reasonably should for funeral proceedings.
Overnight Casket&rsquo;s goal is to not only deliver quality, dignified products suitable for your loved ones, but also to do so in a manner that successfully helps you manage your funeral costs. Therefore, we have put together a guide of simple steps you should take while planning a funeral.

Pre-Plan in Advance
While it at times cannot be pleasant, thinking about funeral plans in advance (if possible) of the death of your loved ones gives you an extremely large advantage in regards to funeral arrangements in a variety of ways:

Expand Your Options &nbsp;&ndash; Planning in advance gives you the advantage with talking to multiple funeral homes, mortuaries, funeral agencies to get the best possible deal. &nbsp;Pre-planning allows you to comparison shop without pressure or time constraints. When you have time to make decisions, they are more likely to be informed.
No Time Constraint &ndash; Planning in advance takes away any time constraints from your decision.&nbsp; Taking your time in any decision allows you to become more informed about the process.
Remove Emotionial Distraction&nbsp;&ndash; Planning in advance helps you make a sound decision, without the distraction of grief being involved.&nbsp; The outburst of emotion can tend to cloud judgment.
Scout Location &ndash; Selecting the cemetery plot for your loved is also best planned in advance. It ensures the family is in agreement on a resting site.&nbsp; It also gives the person a chance for some input in regards to his/her final resting place.

&nbsp;
Also please note, make absolutely sure any and all funeral details you have listed are put in writing. Send copies to your immediate family members, friends, attorney, or anyone else you entrust with the task of carrying out your intended funeral proceedings.&nbsp; Please do not put these funeral details in a safe deposit box or anywhere else as it might not be accessible to your intended party prior to the funeral.
&nbsp;
Funeral Home Tips
Consumers shopping for funeral necessities are protected by the United States Federal Trade Commission's 'Funeral Rule'. &nbsp;These procedures ensure fair trade practices and protection for consumers.&nbsp; Please, for your protection, take a moment and review the FTC&rsquo;s Funeral Rule prior to your purchasing of any funeral services &amp; products.

Here are some additional tips that can help in your dealings with a funeral home:

Always negotiate &ndash; It is your right to negotiate a fair price.&nbsp; Oftentimes you will get a better price by bargaining.
Familiarize yourself with the local funeral and burial laws.&nbsp; Funeral homes must specify any local law requirements in regards to services or expenses.
Compare our General Price List to that of a few other funeral homes.
Alert the funeral home to fact that you are a comparison shopper.&nbsp; Make sure to get a list of all expenses and fees they charge
Do not let the funeral home coerce you into buying a one of the costly funeral packages.&nbsp; Purchase only the products and services that you want/need.
If you end up purchasing a casket online, the funeral home must accept it.&nbsp; The FTC Funeral Rule requires the funeral home to accept any casket the family chooses, regardless of where it was bought.
Do not reveal to the funeral home if insurance benefits are covering the funeral costs &ndash; with this information, they will often adjust their costs upwards to claim the entire amount.

Excellent experience with Overnight Caskets
Posted By: Ellen W. (Los Angeles, CA)
Recently, a close family friend passed away suddenly. We found this company on Google. Their casket prices were considerably less than the funeral homes we visited. They also offered free shipping anywhere in California , so we tried them. The representative was kind and understanding. The beautiful casket arrived on time the next day. With funeral costs being so expensive, their prices came as a quite a relief to us. We highly appreciate and sincerely recommend this company. &nbsp;

Failure to follow the regulations of the cemetery can result in the stone delivery being refused. If the headstone is refused by the cemetery all charges incurred, including return shipping and possible remaking of the stone are the purchaser&acute;s responsibility. Overnight Caskets will not contact your cemetery directly.&nbsp;
What are the size requirements for headstones?

What style of headstone do you allow?&nbsp;
Overnight Caskets has a large selection of styles to choose from. Custom styles are available upon request.&nbsp;
What type of material is required?&nbsp;

Is paint allowed on the headstone?&nbsp;

The paint used on all headstones is special monument grade paint, specifically designed to be used on headstones. If the cemetery requires no paint then please indicate that requirement in the comments of your order. This will be done at no charge.&nbsp;
Are Lawn Mower Proof Edges or Beveled Edges required?&nbsp;
If required, please specify in the comments section of our order form. Additional charges apply.

Plot number&nbsp;
Location on the stone (i.e. Lower Right corner)&nbsp;
Size of plot number (i.e. 3&frasl;4&rdquo;, 5&frasl;8&rdquo;)&nbsp;
&nbsp;Overnight Caskets will engrave the plot number for no additional charge.&nbsp;
Is paperwork required?&nbsp;

Are pictures allowed on a headstone?&nbsp;
Ceramic photos are permanent kiln fired digital images. Any original photo or scanned image can be reproduced and permanently fired into a variety of oval, square and rectangular size ceramic tiles that will withstand the test of time. When we place your ceramic on your headstone we sand carve the granite to the shape and depth of the ceramic so it is inlayed flush with the surface. This process further protects your ceramic from the elements and acts as a prevention against vandalism.&nbsp;
NOTE: Ceramic orders can take up to 8 weeks for production.
