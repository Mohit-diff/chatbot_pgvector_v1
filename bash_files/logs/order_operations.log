/home/differenz83/Documents/AI_Internal_Chatbot/chatbot_pgvector/src/order_operations.py:216: LangChainPendingDeprecationWarning: This class is pending deprecation and may be removed in a future version. You can swap to using the `PGVector` implementation in `langchain_postgres`. Please read the guidelines in the doc-string of this class to follow prior to migrating as there are some differences between the implementations. See <https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-postgres> for details about the new implementation.

This change will allow for more efficient querying that involves filtering based on metadata. Please note that filtering operators have been changed when using JSONB metadata to be prefixed with a $ sign to avoid name collisions with columns. If you're using an existing database, you will need to create a db migration for your metadata column to be JSONB and update your queries to use the new operators.
